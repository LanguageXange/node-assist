## Simple Voice Assistant with Socket.IO, Web Speech API, & Express.

![Demo App](/demo.png)

Check out the [live demo here](https://cool-voice.herokuapp.com/)

**For it to work, please make sure to enable the microphone access and allow pop-ups.**

When you mention the keywords such as "code", "developer", "get hired", "get started", the voice assistant will open a new page related to the keyword.

If you go to `index.js`, you will see an array of hardcoded keywords.
